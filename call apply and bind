call - call is method is used to invoke a function directly by passing reference which points this keyword inside function 
and with object we can pass multiple arguments
apply - call is method is used to invoke a function directly by passing reference which points this keyword inside function 
and with object we can pass array argument
bind - Bind does not directly invoke the function or we can say it can create a copy of function that we can use to invoke later
